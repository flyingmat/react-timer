`react-timer` is a small "library"/project for displaying time deltas.  

A demo example demonstrates support for declaratively/reactively timing a `Promise`, to automatically display how long an asynchronous operation has been running for.  

Demo available at [https://paramtt.github.io/react-timer](https://paramtt.github.io/react-timer).
